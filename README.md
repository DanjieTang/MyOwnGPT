# MyOwnGPT
As part of my internship under Professor Sanner at U of T, I had the pleasure of creating a conversational recommendation system using OpenAI's API. The goal of the project was to develop a GPT that could engage in human-like conversations, based on the insights from the paper "A workflow analysis of context-driven conversational recommendation". It was a fun and rewarding project that I'm excited to have worked on.
